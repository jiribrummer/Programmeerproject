            	This web page aims to give insight in the question whether bodily expression of emotions evolved over time. For this visualization the period 1600-1800 is used. Particularly the periods 1600 - 1660 (Renaissance), 1660 - 1750 (Classicism) and 1750 - 1800 (Enlightenment) are believed to differ in this aspect and are therefore of interest to examine. This visualization can be used to explore data of theater plays of that time. The text of those plays are tagged with emotion labels, and therefore the different emotions can be compared over time.<br><br>Click on the Visualization button above to explore the data.
